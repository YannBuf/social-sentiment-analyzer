Who''s here because Steam sold it to them for $3 in December 2024?,@DavidDouglasJr,1139
I hate when I''m trying to further the goals of the Roman empire but my Legions keep speaking German.,@Z4gle,858
"Number 1 tip should be to go to settings and show yields on HUD ribbons. Knowledge is power, especially in this game.",@kassuhei,665
"I remember buying this game the day it came out. It was mostly negative in steam reviews and everything still played civ 5, but I still liked it because it was easy to learn. Now its so popular it''s crazy",@Kfo221,265
"Got this for $3 on the PS store and I thought clicking """"New to Civilization"""" in the beginning when it asked would give me tips and tell me stuff, but it literally tells you jack shit.",@sneakgamecrazy,133
"Anyone wanting him to talk slower, set the playback speed to .75",@skipgiblets,111
The title should be renamed to beginners guide to civ 6 for civ 5 players... too fast narration and difficult to keep up for completely new player like me,@prince_warhero,99
just bought on springsale.. thankyou for the guide,@Redribbon_iv,63
"I''m new to civilization games, this was a massive help, thanks.",@maxpayne044,61
your the first person ive actually had to slow a video down for to understand whats going on lol appreciate the guide,@LetsPlayBrick,56
Netflix gave this game to me for free. First time playing. Everyone else has modern cities while I''m still building huts and castles,@laughingman7882,52
Crazy to think Civ 6 is 8 years old.,@redluke8119,52
So basically you need a civilization 6 associates degree to play and understand what is happening.,@eagle25311,47
Have this game in library with all expansions. Have always wanted to play it but I gave up at min. 6 lol. That is way too much ui/learning. Thank you for an excellent vid anyway haha :),@Yxar,46
"I hate this type of guides: """"there is not a right or wrong action here, it depends on your goal"""". C''mon, the whole reason why I watch these videos is to get an understanding on the goal options, and some explanation about how that should influence the actions.",@kennethfm,23
Got this game for 4 bucks and did 10 hour on first sitting lmao,@bulldog6545,22
"Thanks… coming from Civ 5, that was terrifying.",@MrKKmusic,20
"I opened the game & stared at the screen, clicking on things for an hour. This is my first type of these games, & I don''t understand what''s happening, if anything actually is happening, or if I did anything. It''s like I don''t get any feedback, or I just don''t know where or understand what it is.   I don''t want to return it, because I wanted to try & get into 1 of these types of games I never play. Funny, getting mixed up in the corner in Street Fighter 6 does not make me feel this way, but that''s because I can access my tools right in front of my eyes in an instant. This game makes me feel like I wandered into a season of Lost without being an actual cast member.",@jadedbreadncircus9159,19
"Slow down mate, no one’s chasing you.",@chibi_undercover9663,19
At2:08why is the description for Legion in German?,@colerowland8066,18
"So far the best guide I''ve seen for the game. Straight to the point and answers everything I''m curious about, thanks a bunch.",@aishas4909,12
They finally fixed the issues on console so I''m ready to learn,@jonnyboy0127,11
"Nah this aint the beginners guide, I am in 9mins and I understood nothing. If you have no knowledge prior this video aint for you.",@_abhishake_,10
"I''m new, and switch off diplomatic victory because it''s too confusing",@randomoffgrid,9
"If youre really new, set playback to .8x or .85x",@Maverickstyg,8
"Bro, I apologise but I''m completely lost on this and I feel like the information is going by way too fast. 7 minutes into the video, I''m left with an absolute ton of """"What is this?"""" and """"What is that?"""" questions and even though you are going through the UI screens, those questions just keep building up. I don''t know what I''m looking at 95% of the time nor do I even know what the core aim is or where to go to begin something.This all might be a result of the fact that the closest game I''ve played to this is the old Age of Empires games. Haven''t touched or even seen a single Civ game but was interested in something that I could just sit and chill with rather than pull my hair out on Competitive PvP games. So there might be that. Lol.",@AstralXMidnight,8
I can proudly say I’ve been playing the CIV series since the original,@skipgiblets,8
You should talk shlower :o I have difficulty to understand you,@My_Sunrise,7
Bought this game because my buddies convinced me to play it with them. Only to find out that somehow its impossible for me to join them or them join me smh,@alexhood583,6
"Thank you, I''m not exactly a beginner but last time I played was on release and the first few civs dlcs so this caught me up to speed with the DLC specific features like governors and diplomacy",@shroomer3867,5
"I think I''m just going to play the base game, then move on to rise and fall, and finally gathering storm. There''s too much stuff to learn with both DLC''s active.",@colerowland8066,5
This is dumb but in the Early Game section. Why did he eliminate sailing right away when he’s right next to the ocean? It seemed like he zeroed in on pottery/mining/animal husbandry,@jemering94,5
Came from Epic games when they gave free as mystery game??,@sarthak_j2897,5

"2:05Why is there evrythink in english but """"legion"""" is explained in german?",@knuthansen8524,4
"On the base game, Trajan (Rome) is OP as hell. Having the starting monument only in your first city would nearly make that ability balanced (for base leaders)   The power creep is real though. Ethiopia is insanely powerful with a couple of city states (even without, though later) you can purchase troops with your ever growing faith pool (duplicate resources (literally any kind) provide exponential faith when located in a single city. Ex: 1 stone = 1 faith, 3 stone = 9 faith, and 5 stone = 25 faith. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but on an abundant resource map, Menelik II is a force to be reckoned with and dwarfs all of the base Civs (though other expansion Civs have different strengths that make them on par, arguably more powerful in other regards, this ability is just the easiest to abuse in the early game)",@Prof_Bort_Yammy,3
Brooooo you finally did a civ video this game is the best been watching all your videos for ever,@desmondwindigo5143,3

First time Civ player here.  Just picked it up Civ 6 Anthology for €8.50 on Fanatical. Never played turn based games before but got interested because Civ 7 release. Let’s see how this goes,@Never_Whatever,1
Thinking about giving this a try thanks to Netflix lol,@Maminas777,1
"Just started playing.  Very fun so far, but there are a TON of mechanics and ways to win and currently I feel like I''m just randomly doing things with no cohesive goal.  When I look at the score of my current game my opponent is ahead of me.  I know my army is way bigger, should I just sack all their cities? lol",@donovanhays,1
"I been playing civ 5 for many many years. I have close to 800 hours. I recently started playing civ 6 and it felt so convoluted, from the new mechanics of having to build amenities a few tiles away from the city, the religion mechanic being very different- or at least appearing that way, the research seems to be randomly put there and if I want x and usually Y was with X, now you have to unlock Z to get to X  And the most important one, I can''t tell whats a luxury, crabs? Sure, but why don''t I see the +4 happiness.",@ninjalawzo,1
"If you''re new to the game, you should play with the standard rules.  I''m not going to do that in this tutorial for new players.",@willbohland3698,1
as someone who has never played civ game I tried this game and was so confused lol,@Mysteryboy0007,1
Is this applicable on the Netflix version?,@MrtnSlmt,1
0:45i cant change my rule sets why? its stuck on standard,@Mohdzn,1
That was an amazingly detailed and helpful video. I almost understood 4 words. Lol. I''ll have to watch then play then watch again to understand more. Thank you for the detailed information.,@charlesphillips9718,
"Thanks, I’ll probably need to watch this video about 10 more times before I absorb anything, but I appreciate the effort you put into this!",@melindamercier6811,
"I''m not a new player, I''m a returning one, and this video has helped me massively. Thank you!",@angrykouhai2053,
