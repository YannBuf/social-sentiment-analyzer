"Congratulation to Colossor Order for 10 year Anniversary! I''ve been your loyal customer to both Cities I & II. I''ve played your game since when I was highschool all the way to the University and to still now. Thanks to your game, it really helped me to find my passion and build my career, now I am Civil Engineer which I work at Traffic Engineering Department for my residing city. Surprisingly, there is lot of people in my department who plays Cities Skyline because it is just that good and can do whatever they want to do. This game will go forever until I die and I hope to see another Cities III or IV or more in my life!  Thanks again for creating such a wonderful game :)",@geonheecho590,16
