Limiting yourself to one tile for that SimCity(2013) experience.,@fredrickvonstien861,5163
I love the idea of taking a completed one tile city and expanding it by one tile each episode.  Make an entire map that is high density.,@Geeko170,3094
"Finally, a sillier and challenging episode. Don''t take me wrong, I love the long-term series with their realistic approach, but I find it most interesting when the real life professional takes a break and makes something more creative and light-hearted like this.",@Foreck,763
"You always say it is so """"dark"""" to put the elder care close to a grave yard. But it really makes sense and many elders prefer it that way. Couples going into care homes are extremely rare. most of the time, one dies first. the other is left alone and the loneliness contributes to the decline in health. So the elder care home next to the grave yard, where many of the patients have their deceased spouse is really sought after. Just my 2 cents.",@wolfim.3343,749
Phil''s giddy laughter throughout the chaos is perfection.,@Shanerz21,725
Dude has the most soothing voice and the most terrifying laugh.,@faz1015,608
"I love to see Phil doing more goofy content like this, it’s very refreshing.  Also, in another comment I saw someone say you should do a city with unlimited everything, so you can just let your creativity fly without worry. Once you’ve used up all your nodes on the one project (I forgot if it was nicolet or Clearwater lol) you should take into consideration doing the unlimited everything play through. Just to spice things up.",@adamj.russell5968,405
"Other creators are trying the challenge, too!  Drop a link to your video here and I''ll add it to the pinned comment!  Ozzie Mike Plays -https://youtu.be/qFhbXPTnOhEGaming with Rev -https://youtu.be/kwCn0wrdXsM",@CityPlannerPlays,306
You laugh like the grunt who pulls the lever to lower the protagonist into a vat of bubbling green goo while the antagonist explains his plans.,@BrentBowersWithTics,203
Seeing the city limits from every angle gives me SimCity 2013 vibes.,@fastica,194
I have never seen such an elegant looking city in a One Tile City Challenge!,@capedkat,152
Phil! Thank you so much for your content and the effort you put into these videos. Keep it going!,@Matthewy.,135
Phil building a one-tile city as a gimick in a one hour vid.  Proceeds to make it look better than all of my multi-year builds.,@toonieven,111
"Something Cities Skylines needs to do better, is highlight when you have issues, like not having hospital, police or whatever. In Simcity 2013 you would get a red ring around the icon.  Really hope they improve this in Cities Skylines 2.  The UI needs to communicate clearly with the player and nobody watches those bird tweet things.",@RMJ1984,102
Cemetery next to elder care. This level of efficiency is why we come here,@MrPorkerson,95
"CPP: Our power line is destroyed but it''s ok, we have a wind turbine.   Wind turbine:catches fire",@TheRealTaz89,79
"Funny enough, I just started playing on this map yesterday. In the first tile, I got up to 17,000 but it was entirely low density and a fairly boring grid. Traffic bounced between 75% and 81%.   I wonder what impact """"High Tech Housing"""" would have had for you. I know you don''t like to use it city wide, but for a challenge like this, it might have gotten the city over the 30k milestone.",@VaingloriousGaming,63
There’s something so pure about a 1 tile city. I cannot wait to watch you fire up CS2. I hope you have a live stream planned for the release.,@ethanguidry841,53
"This is a Super hard flex, well taken, and demonstrated by the master planer compared to the other one tiles I’ve seen",@albertgreene313,52
I''ve learnt so much from watching your videos and have implemented them in my own city. Thanks for the amazing videos.,@DG0011,36
Your laugh is so random and scaryno offense tho,@Hoxistedious,35
I’d love to see this city expand,@TheStorff86,34
Was hoping for a single-point urban interchange but your interchange did turn out lovely,@mosphaera,19
his laughter scared the shit out of me,@heavysaltt,17
"hi from Rockford, IL. I’ve been a fan since 2020–love this channel and now my step son has now gotten into your content as well. please build a city w everything unlocked immediately and infinite money. we know you know how to play the game right but we watch bc of your planning and creativity. i want to see the biggest, best city you can make w unlimited resources.",@JSEarhart,17
You sir are an amazing communicator. I could listen to you describe pretty much anything. And your enthusiasm is top notch.,@Tubalcain422,16
"If you think of countries with very limited space, like Monaco or Andorra, they use a lot of underground infrastructures. Maybe you could build some tunnels to improve the traffic flow (a solution used in Boston too, not just Europe). All in all, still an amazing video!",@carloangrisano,15
"I think it would be really cool for there to be one tile challenges in CS2, where we can choose the biome and it randomly generates a tile for us!",@rygarzayt,15
Your presentation skills - especially during the introduction where lots of simple graphics assist your explanations in keeping a steady flow - are amazing! Truly one of the GOATs of CS YouTubing,@Infrastructurist,14
"""""Hopefully I don''t kill the city again.""""  Just the words you want to hear from the city planner.",@SoDakJason,13
I''d love to see you make a series out of this where every episode you expand the city by one tile and completely max it out before going to the next one,@tatodrawz,13
why do you laugh like jeff bezos,@babyobliterator405,12
Thanks for all the amazing content Phil! Do you (or anyone else here) know if the tax system is going to be overhauled in CS2? I do not believe I have done anything other than the classic crank it to 12% and forget about it for the rest of the game tactic and would love to see some more strategy incorporated.,@tmack1317,12
I enjoy that about halfway through you''ve essentially created Gotham City with the massive crime rate.,@grey1916,11

this guy''s laugh sounds like a rich man''s laugh,@Nononeno-eq7nv,9
The earthquake for the landfills is genius holy Phil,@itsyaboi7417,8
"Honestly this could be a mini series - filling out and developing one tile at a time before buying another.  Because my eye just looks at the edges of the city and thinks """"that is just begging for development"""".  But yeah, beautiful little city.  A lot lower in population then I was expecting (40,000 was my low estimate) but you didn''t go for the high density grid system so that makes perfect sense.  You went for style, not bulk.  And that''s great.  Makes me want to try this myself without falling back to my old bad habits.",@andromidius,8
The absolute moxie to do a one tile challenge that is mostly water. Great video!,@joshuasims5421,8
"I  love how happy he is, and how much he laughs! I love how much fun he is having!",@MIGHT_OFFICIAL,7
"The One-Tile city is awesome a mini Vedre beach. I think Creating a man-made Island as an amusement park, some Comercial and hotels may be a port would be good as well, you  can aquire dirt by eating from hill infront of the solar plant and will also give space for crucial services in that area",@amenboughanmi5819,6
Thanks for all your content! I enjoyed this build just as much as Verde Beach and Clearwater County.,@chew8500,6
You should turn this into a mini series. Use this as your downtown and then build the rest of the city in the remaining 8 tiles,@paolomaurini8534,6

"Literally spit my drink out when you put the eldercare next to the cemetery to be """"efficient""""",@Sielleis,5
"I did this one time on my switch because I didn''t feel like buying a new tile and I believe I maxed it out at 22-24k people, with industries and commercial. Sadly it looked disgusting and had terrible planning and traffic. But it was making 36k at one point so I guess I did something right lol",@gabrielmora8403,5
You should expand the city and add suburbs and outlying districts. Could be a nice miniseries.,@MartelSays,5
His laugh is something else lol,@WafflesArePeak,4
Just started rewatching the Verde Beach playlist and I must say your video editing and quality has come a long and great way !! Keep up the great work Phil - lotsa love from Austria,@maideis,4
"Could you do a desert city build with the common issues that plague the US Southwest?  Issues including water shortages and conservancy, as well as explosion in population.  It would be intriguing to see the perspective of an actual city planner.",@jordanhurd1988,4
Prison Architect has a very nice Planning mode. CS2 should definitely have a similar feature.,@CVAGBowl,4
it''s wild to watch you play chaotic like this. it''s like watching bob ross do an abstract painting,@pedro_mab,4
"it would have been fun seeing you go back and fix this city like you did with Lakevalley, but still keeping it one tile city.",@kallexiao8592,4
"Wow, cities skylines finally simulating the finances of building roads and low density housing",@micahsarm,4
Really like this city asthetically. Maybe consider expanding beyond the one tile for a mini series. I''d watch it :P,@_fruitnveg,4
I thought you might build an artificial island like the Palm Island lol,@s_k.99,4
Wow good. Thank you for taking the time to produce quality content. What do you think of repeating the process by adding one square at a time creating “self sufficient tiles”? Would that break any population records?,@jdpierce2359,3

"Another great video to start the weekend!  However, I was surprised to see there were no subway station in the IT district - another loop in such a dense area might have helped the traffic flow a bit.",@maximesawicki1991,3

I wanted to say sorry for not sticking around reliably, but this video really puts into perspective how hard you, and youtubers as a whole, put effort into these videos. You may never see this, but thank you for your time and effort. I''m going to try and be better and be more consistent because you are quite deserving of it.",@Linkstryfe,2

"This looks awesome. You probably need a couple more subway connections around the offices and residents close to the highway, and you got a massive improvement.  Also, something to consider is to keep the series going with opening an adjacent tile and feeling it in. You got the border of the tile from the first town and started including Industries into the build. Plus you can keep it with 9 tiles or go to 25 if you want to keep the challenge going. That way you end with one massive city",@jaredstivers,2
One thing I might have changed is the landward metro having it swing north at the last current stop and terminating in the office park. Otherwise this is a lovely looking city,@seabassplayer9308,2

We can all make amazing large or expansive cities, but I love to see people try to take all the intricacies of a city and cram them into a 1x1 tile.

"Hey CPP! Love your videos and never thought I would be the one to ever give you tips on this game lol, but as a person who enjoys playing with limited money/milestones, here are 2 tricks i learned:  1. set your power and water to 50% in the budget panel. When you first get the notification that you''re running out of electricity/water, instead of buying more, just keep increasing the budget. I like to go in 25% increments so it also gives me time to save for the next power plant.  2. As SOON as you get your first milestone, you gotta increase taxes to 12%. They wont complain about it I promise.",@hypanthia,
